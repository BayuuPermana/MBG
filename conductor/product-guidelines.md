# Product Guidelines

These guidelines define the design principles, user experience goals, and communication standards for GiziSync to ensure a consistent and high-quality platform for the "Makan Bergizi Gratis" (MBG) program.

# Design Principles

### 1. Task-Oriented Efficiency & Data Depth
- **For Kitchen Operators:** The UI must prioritize speed and accuracy. Use large, clear input fields, logical multi-step forms, and prominent "Save" or "Submit" actions to minimize cognitive load during busy kitchen operations.
- **For Administrators:** Dashboards and reports must provide high-density information. Use well-structured tables with sorting, filtering, and export capabilities to support rigorous auditing and analytical tasks.

### 2. Clean & Authoritative Visual Identity
- **Aesthetic:** A professional, modern look that conveys trust and stability. Avoid unnecessary decorative elements that might distract from the data.
- **Color Palette:** Use a base of clean neutrals (whites, grays) with high-contrast typography. 
- **Status Colors:** Use a standardized system for alerts and feedback:
  - **Green:** Successful submissions, verified audits.
  - **Blue:** Information and neutral progress.
  - **Amber/Orange:** Pending reviews or missing data.
  - **Red:** Critical errors, audit failures, or price discrepancies.

# User Experience (UX)

### Navigation & Flow
- The application should follow a hierarchical structure that mirrors the user's role. Kitchen Operators see reporting tools immediately, while BGN Admins see high-level oversight metrics.
- Navigation should be persistent and clear, allowing users to jump between key modules (Reports, Commodities, Kitchens) without losing context.

### Form Design
- Every form field must have a clear label and, where necessary, a brief description or placeholder.
- Implement real-time validation to catch errors early (e.g., non-numeric input for meal counts).

# Prose & Communication

### Tone and Language
- **Official Language:** All user-facing text must use formal Indonesian (**Bahasa Indonesia yang baku**).
- **Direct & Professional:** Instructions should be concise and instructional. Use the imperative mood for actions (e.g., "Simpan Laporan" instead of "Silakan simpan laporan Anda").
- **Clarity over Creativity:** Avoid jargon or overly technical terms where a simpler, more direct Indonesian word suffices.
